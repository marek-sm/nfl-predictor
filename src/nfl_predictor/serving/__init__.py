"""Prediction pipelines and delivery (e.g., Discord webhooks).

This package will eventually contain the logic required to:

- generate weekly predictions from the latest market data,
- format outputs for downstream consumers (e.g., Discord embeds).

It is currently a placeholder and intentionally does not execute
