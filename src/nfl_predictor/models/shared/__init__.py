"""Shared model utilities (calibration, encoders, encoders, etc.).

This package is reserved for components that are reused across
multiple modeling tasks, such as:

- probability calibration helpers (e.g., isotonic / Platt)
- encoding utilities
- common model evaluation helpers

For now it acts as a placeholder so the package can be imported
cleanly without side effects.
